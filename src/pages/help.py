        ### How Our ML Model Works
        
        #### **Training Data:**
        - Model is trained on historical pipeline data
        - Uses `final.csv` as the training dataset
        - Continuously updated for better accuracy
        
        #### **Features Used:**
        - Gas volume measurements (instantaneous & setpoint)
        - Valve position data
        - Rolling standard deviation
        - Time-based features (hour, day)
        - Calculated ratios and differences
        
        #### **Model Details:**
        - **Algorithm**: Random Forest Regressor
        - **Features**: 8 engineered features
        - **Output**: Hydrate formation likelihood (0-10 scale)
        - **Accuracy**: RÂ² score displayed during training
        
        #### **Prediction Process:**
        1. **Data Preprocessing**: Clean and prepare your data
        2. **Feature Engineering**: Create derived features
        3. **Scaling**: Normalize data for consistent predictions
        4. **Prediction**: Generate hydrate likelihood scores
        5. **Risk Classification**: Categorize into risk levels
        
        #### **Model Performance:**
        - Performance metrics are shown after training
        - MSE (Mean Squared Error) and RÂ² values provided
        - Model can be retrained with new data

        ### Common Questions
        
        #### **Q: What file format should I use?**
        A: Upload CSV files with the required columns. Ensure your data includes timestamps and the four main pipeline variables.
        
        #### **Q: How accurate are the predictions?**
        A: Model accuracy depends on data quality and similarity to training data. Check the RÂ² score shown during training for current performance.
        
        #### **Q: Can I upload multiple files?**
        A: Yes! Use the "Batch Upload" tab to upload multiple CSV files at once. Each file will be treated as a separate dataset.
        
        #### **Q: Why are my predictions not showing?**
        A: Ensure your data has the required columns and the ML model has finished training. Check the "Machine Learning Model" section for status.
        
        #### **Q: How do I interpret the risk levels?**
        A: Risk levels are color-coded:
        - Green (Low): Normal operation
        - Yellow (Medium): Monitor closely
        - Red (High): Take preventive action
        - Dark Red (Critical): Immediate intervention required
        
        #### **Q: Can I download my results?**
        A: Yes! Use the "Export Results" section to download your data with predictions included.
        
        #### **Q: What if my data is missing some columns?**
        A: The system will attempt to calculate missing values (like Rolling Std) automatically. However, the main pipeline variables are required.
        
        #### **Q: How often should I retrain the model?**
        A: Retrain when you have new representative data or notice decreased accuracy. The model is cached for performance.
